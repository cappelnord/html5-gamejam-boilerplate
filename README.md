Gamejam Boilerplate for HTML5
================

Nothing fancy here, I'd use this mainly in case of a music game. It has a basic structure and some handy stuff allready built in. It also has a working copy of the Zinedine Web Audio library. I wouldn't recommend using it, as it's pretty work in progress and not documented.

I haven't found the time yet to adopt a proper game framework, so it'll be just me and the browser.

Uses the following:
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) for stuff
* [Tween.js](http://www.createjs.com/#!/TweenJS) for tweens
* [Sylvester](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com) for vector/matrix math
